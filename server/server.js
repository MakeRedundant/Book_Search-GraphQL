typeDefs: This is the type definition for your GraphQL schema. It defines the shape of your API, including types (objects), queries (read operations), mutations (write operations), and subscriptions 
resolvers: Resolvers are functions that define how to fetch the data for each type and field specified in the schema. They provide the instructions for turning a GraphQL operation into data.
context: authMiddleware: The context option allows you to pass in a context object to your resolvers. In this case, authMiddleware is being used as the context.
The context object can hold authentication information, database connections, and other shared data that your resolvers might need.
