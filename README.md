## 📄 Description
This is a web application that allows users to search for their desired books using the Google Books API. Users can sign in/sign up to save their favorite books to be viewed later. The frontend was built using React and Bootstrap, while password hashing was implemented using bcrypt. GraphQL, Apollo Server, and Mongoose were used for the database, providing efficient data management and querying capabilities. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) were employed for secure user authentication and authorization. The application was deployed on Heroku, ensuring accessibility and reliability. Vite was used for fast and efficient development, enhancing the development workflow.

## 🖥️Installation

Users can clone the code and run npm install to install the dependencies
```pip
 npm install
```

Afterwards users can run the command ```npm run build``` which will run the Vite build process which will bundle the React source code
```pip
npm run build
```

Afterwards users can run the command ```npm run develop``` which will executes the vite command, which starts the development server provided by Vite  
and allows users to run the code on their local host
```pip
npm run develop
```
This sequence ensures that your client-side code is built before starting the server.

Otherwise this app requires use of the Vite application to be used as well as the following installations.
